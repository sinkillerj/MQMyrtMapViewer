# Info
This is a browser based reimplementation of the compass map from MagiQuest Myrtle Beach. The original version was a CompassQuest reward that showed the location of effects needed to complete other quests in the game.

It is my hope that having a way to view this data will help with future virtual recreations of the Myrtle Beach location.

# Limitations
This, like the original, is based on a artistic rendering that in some ways does not represent the actual floor plan. While a floor plan of the building is available it would require new coordinates, and I have no plans to make a more accurate map at this time.

The original coordinates were converted to ones compatible with this new reimplementation, while they should be 99% accurate to the original some could stand to be moved as they were in odd spots to begin with. Feel free to open a PR with any requested changes.
